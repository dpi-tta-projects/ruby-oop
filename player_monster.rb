#
# Challenge:
#   Create two classes — Player and Monster — that both have an #attack method.
#   Loop through them and call .attack to show polymorphic behavior.
#
# Expected Output:
#   Player attacks with sword!
#   Monster attacks with claws!
#
# Hint:
#   Each class should define its own version of the #attack method.
#   You can store both objects in an array and loop through them using .each.
